# Description

suitpikali is a project that maybe originated from watching a little to much James Bond, Johnny English and all the other same genre Movies.

It is based on a Raspberry pi running a Kali Linux Operating System which is an Operating System featuring many penetration testing tools such as Johntheripper, Hashcat, Aircrack-ng or Hydra for Password Attacks, Wireshark for Network Traffic Monitoring or Nmap for port scanning. Since there is no space for a Mouse it features a Touchscreen in the top part of the suitcase which is powered through a Voltage Transformer because the operation voltage is not the same as the Power supply.

The Raspberry pi uses a Kali Linux compatible Wifi extender that is capable of switching to Monitor Mode. Monitor Mode allows to view the traffic on wireless networks.

Powering can be done by a normal Power supply, however it can also be used on the way since it features a Powerbank which allows it to run for about 4-5 hours without a Power supply, thanks to the Power efficiency of the Raspberry pi.
